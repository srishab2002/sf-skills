# Salesforce Skills Library

This repository provides a curated collection of Salesforce agent skills for building applications. It includes skills for Agentforce agents, Lightning apps, Flow, Apex, SOQL, Lightning Web Components (LWC), UI bundles, objects and fields, permission sets, and related areas.

The skills are contributed by Salesforce and the broader community. It’s optimized for Agentforce Vibes and can be used with any AI tool that supports skills.

> ⚠️ **Expect frequent changes.** The Salesforce skills library is evolving rapidly as we refine patterns and incorporate feedback. Skills may be renamed, restructured, or removed between releases — they do not follow the same stability guarantees as GA platform APIs. If you’ve forked or synced the repository, be prepared for upstream changes that may conflict with local modifications. This repository is always the source of truth.

## 🚀 Usage

| **Tool** | **Usage** |
|----------|-------------|
| **Agentforce Vibes** | Skills are auto-installed and auto-updated |
| **OpenCode, Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, [more](https://agentskills.io/)** | `npx skills add forcedotcom/sf-skills` |

## 📦 Samples

The `samples/` folder contains synced sample apps. For example, `samples/ui-bundle-template-app-react-sample-b2e/` tracks the npm package `@salesforce/ui-bundle-template-app-react-sample-b2e` (nightly and on manual trigger via GitHub Actions). 

To run the same sync locally from the repository root: 

```bash
npm install
npm run sync-react-b2e-sample
```

The GitHub Action runs the same commands and opens a pull request when the npm package version changes. For more information, see [samples/README.md](samples/README.md).
